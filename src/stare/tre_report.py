"""STARE's intrinsic TRE report — the method's own Target Registration Error, à la VALIS.

Built from the same features/correlations the registration itself uses, so it needs no external
ground truth (exactly what makes VALIS's ``error_df`` intrinsic). Two entry points share this
builder so the ``_tre.json`` has one shape:

  * ``coarse_tre_px``     — RMS residual of the DISK matches after the global rigid M0 (rigid-stage
                            TRE; directly comparable to VALIS's rigid error).
  * ``rigid_tre_px``      — percentiles of the per-tile rigid-stage misalignment, plus the full
                            per-tile ``tiles`` list = a *spatial* TRE heatmap VALIS does not give.
  * ``residual_after_px`` — (when measured) percentiles of the per-tile residual AFTER the mesh is
                            applied: STARE's post-registration final-accuracy number, the analogue
                            of VALIS's non-rigid error.

Pure NumPy.

    **The percentile summaries cover ACCEPTED records only.** A tile that put no valid,
    in-range vector into the lattice (``stare.solve.tile_accepted``) contributed nothing to the
    mesh, and its ``tre_rigid`` -- the median of no valid vector -- is not a measurement of a
    real misalignment. Averaging it in describes a registration that was never performed.
    ``tiles`` still carries every record, accepted or not, because *where* tiles were dropped
    is exactly what the spatial heatmap is for.

    A record with no ``accepted`` key counts as accepted.
