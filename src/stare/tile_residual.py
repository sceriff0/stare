"""Per-tile refinement primitive for the STARE registration method.

After the global M0 anchor, a tile's moving crop and the reference crop differ only by a small,
near-translational residual. :func:`residual_displacement` recovers it sub-pixel with phase
correlation and returns it as ``(dx, dy)`` — the whole-tile displacement,
i.e. the amount to add to a moving-tile coordinate to land it on the reference — together with the
tile's local Target Registration Error (the magnitude of that residual) and the correlation's
normalised error, which is how a caller tells a real match from a peak in noise.

Pure NumPy + scikit-image.

def foreground_fraction(tile):
    """Fraction of ``tile`` above its own Otsu threshold — how much of it is on-section.

    Emitted on every control point (``ref_fg`` / ``mov_fg``) and, as of this change, **gated on
    by nothing**. It exists so the next phase can be measured on real slides rather than
    synthetic tiles, and so ``--out-tre`` can eventually say WHY a tile was dropped.

    What it is worth, measured over the same dense sweep that pins the accepted-but-wrong band
    (21 blanking fractions x 4 geometries x 3 seeds; 200 accepted configs, 68 of them wrong):

        signal              threshold losing 0 correct    wrong tiles rejected
        mov_fg                      >= 0.0371                 41/68  (60.3%)
        mov_fg / ref_fg             >= 0.4165                 44/68  (64.7%)

    So it is a REAL separator and a PARTIAL one: ~60-65% of the exposure removed at no cost to
    real tissue, but the distributions still overlap (correct tiles reach down to 0.0371, wrong
    tiles up to 0.0624), so about a third survives any per-tile threshold. Neighbourhood
    consistency is still needed. The ratio beating ``mov_fg`` alone is why both crops are
    measured rather than only the moving one.

    Returns 0.0 for a constant tile — including the all-zeros crop ``tiled_reg_tile`` fabricates
    when the moving region falls outside the slide. Otsu has no threshold to find there, and 0.0
    is the honest answer rather than an exception.

    """Sub-pixel residual displacement aligning ``mov_tile`` to ``ref_tile``.

    Returns ``(dx, dy, tre, error)``:

    - ``(dx, dy)`` is the control-point displacement (add it to a moving coordinate to reach the
      reference);
    - ``tre = hypot(dx, dy)`` is the tile's local rigid-stage TRE — the pre-refinement
      misalignment magnitude;
    - ``error`` is scikit-image's normalised correlation error, in ``[0, 1]``, where 0 is a
      perfect match and ~1 means the two crops share no structure at all.

    ``error`` is the *confidence* of the match. Phase correlation always returns a peak, so a
    background tile or a tile straddling the section edge yields a displacement that is
    indistinguishable from a small real residual by magnitude; its ``error`` (~1.0 against real
    tissue's ~0.04) gives it away. STARE v1's SOLVE gated one-point-per-tile control points on it;
    since STARE v2 this function is the whole-tile oracle (the post-refinement residual in
    ``stare.pipeline`` and the reference ``stare.vector_grid``'s tests compare against), and the
    pipeline's per-window vectors are validated by peak ratio instead.

    ``error`` is **NaN** where scikit-image cannot compute it at all — notably when either crop is
    empty, which is what ``tiled_reg_tile.py`` manufactures when the moving crop falls outside the
    slide. Callers must treat NaN as "reject", not as "small".

    The correlation kernel is analogous to ASHLAR's: **whiten** each crop with a DoG high-pass
    (a sigma=3 Gaussian subtracted; ASHLAR uses a Laplacian/LoG) to strip the low-frequency
    intensity mismatch between stains, then **Hann window** to taper the non-periodic tile edges the FFT would otherwise wrap. Plain (un-phase-
    normalised) cross-correlation is used deliberately — phase normalisation amplifies the
    high-frequency noise the whitening leaves and destabilises the sub-pixel peak on small tiles.
