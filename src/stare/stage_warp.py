"""reg_qc=2 stage warper for the tiled ('STARE') registration method.

The reg_qc=2 scorer (``bin/warp_seg_qc.py``) is method-agnostic: it scores every stage through an
injected ``warp(slide_name, xy, stage) -> xy`` callable and never imports the registrar itself.
For VALIS that callable comes from ``valis_stage_warp.make_warper`` (a loaded registrar pickle +
BioFormats JVM). This module is its tiled-method counterpart: it builds the *same* callable from a
lightweight STARE transform manifest — a global rigid ``M0`` per slide plus a control-grid mesh
field — with **no VALIS, no JVM, pure NumPy**.

Manifest shape::

    {
      "ref_slide": "<name>",
      "slides": {
        "<name>": {
          "M0":   3x3 affine (forward: native moving coords -> reference frame),
          "mesh": {"grid_x": [...], "grid_y": [...], "displacements": [[[dx,dy],...],...],
                   "interp": "cubic"  (optional; absent = bilinear)} | null,
        },
        ...
      }
    }

Stages
------
``native``   no transform.
``rigid``    the global affine ``M0`` only  — **the reg_qc anchor**.
``refined``  ``M0`` plus the mesh residual, sampled at the native point.

There is no ``micro`` stage and nothing is composed destructively, so — unlike VALIS — every
stage is a first-class transform the manifest can reproduce directly; no pre-micro checkpoint is
needed. The mesh lives in the *reference frame* (the grid is laid on the rigid-warped slide's tile
centres) and is sampled at the rigid position ``M0·xy``; both this warper and the per-tile image
warp sample that same field, so the QC measures exactly the transform that shipped.
